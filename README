This is my multi-cluster environment for Slurm.

I'm excluding the files generated by configuration and compliation in
.gitignore. Build instructions from the base directory of this repo:

```
mkdir build
cd build
../../slurm/configure --prefix=/home/marshall/slurm/master/install --enable-developer --enable-multiple-slurmd --disable-optimizations --with-pam_dir=/home/marshall/slurm/master/install/lib
make.py
cd ..
mkdir discovery1/state
mkdir discovery2/state
mkdir discovery3/state
```
